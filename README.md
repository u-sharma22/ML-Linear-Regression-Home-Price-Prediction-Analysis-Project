 Program Flow
 In this particular project, we are using a dataset that contains information like, Address, Rooms, Type, Price, Seller etc and using that to predict the
 price of a given house. 
However, before you go ahead and make a prediction, it is advised that you first pre-process the data, since it may contain some irregularities and
 noise. In addition, try various tricks and techniques in order to gain the best accuracy in your predictions.

 Part-1: data Exploration and Pre-processing
 1) Load the given dataset 
2) Print all the column names 
3) Describe the data 
4) Drop address, date, postcode, YearBuilt, lattitude, longtitude columns 
5) Find the count of null value in each column 
6) Fill the null value of property count, distance, Bedroom2, Bathroom, Car with 0
 7) Fill Null value of land size and bidding area columns with Mean 
8) Find the unique value in method column 
9) Create a dummy data for categorical data 
Part-2: Working with Model 
1) Create the target data and feature data where target data is price 
2) Create a linear regression model for Target and feature data 
3) Check if the model is overfitting or underfitting or it is accurate 
4) If the model is overfitting then apply ridge and lasso regression algorithms 
5) Extract slope and intercept value from the model 
6) Display Mean Squared Error 
7) Display Mean Absolute Error 
8) Display Root mean Squared error 
9) Display R2 score
